This repository tracks my 90 days journey of revising FPGA design fundamentals, practise Verilog code. As I transition towards a digital designer, and FPGA engineer role, I want to use this to track my progress. 

I asked ChatGPT to create a 90-day bootcamp style plan to revise FPGA. I will be basing the topics based on that checklist which is attached below. I will be using following resources for this learning. 

Book: FPGA Prototyping by Verilog Examples - Pong P. Chu
Tools : EDA playground online + Icarus Verilog Simulator

### FPGA & Verilog 90-Day Bootcamp Checklist

#### Phase 1 — Verilog Foundations (Days 1–21)

- [ ] Day 1 – FPGA architecture, tool install
- [ ] Day 2 – module, ports, wires, regs, AND gate sim
- [ ] Day 3 – Blocking vs non-blocking (= vs <=)
- [ ] Day 4 – always blocks, sensitivity lists
- [ ] Day 5 – Testbench basics: $display, $monitor
- [ ] Day 6 – Parameters & generate blocks (parametric adder)
- [ ] Day 7 – Project: 4-bit counter with testbench
