This repository tracks my 90 days journey of revising FPGA design fundamentals, practise Verilog code. As I transition towards a digital designer, and FPGA engineer role, I want to use this to track my progress. 

I asked ChatGPT to create a 90-day bootcamp style plan to revise FPGA. I will be basing the topics based on that checklist which is attached below. I will be using following resources for this learning. 

Book: FPGA Prototyping by Verilog Examples - Pong P. Chu
Tools : EDA playground online + Icarus Verilog Simulator
